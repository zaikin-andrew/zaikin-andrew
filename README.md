# Hi, I'm Andrei 👋

**Tech Lead · Solution Architect · AI Engineer**

11+ years building production systems that drive revenue and scale. Founded and ran a [25-person software company](https://flo.team) for 8 years — from zero. Hired, trained, sold, architected, coded, and delivered. Shipped 70+ cloud solutions and 300+ media workflow automation for clients including EA, Google, NBCUniversal, CNN, Riot Games, and MGM. Now bringing that founder-operator mindset to product teams that need to move fast and ship reliably.

### What I Do

**Architecture → Production.** I design systems, build critical paths, lead teams through delivery, and stay accountable until it's live and stable. I've owned solution architecture across 200+ engagements — from presales and HLD/LLD to cost modeling and production handoff.

**AI in Production.** Semantic search with RAG and vector embeddings. Auto-clipping with Whisper and Rekognition. Automated annotation pipelines with LLMs. Not demos — shipped features serving real users.

**Team Leadership.** Led cross-functional teams of up to 20 engineers. Mentored 35+ developers. Speaker at tech conferences. I grow people while shipping product.

### Products I've Built

**[Sofile](https://sofile.io)** — B2B/B2C SaaS platform and official Adobe Video Partner
Custom panel enabling native access to cloud media directly from Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, and other Adobe packages. Designed scalable serverless architecture with multi-cloud storage integrations (AWS S3, GCP, IBM, Backblaze, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) and automated workflows for file transfers, metadata handling, encoding, and project sharing. Widely adopted by enterprise post-production studios and individual creators worldwide, handling 15TB+ of media transfers monthly. White-label solution for Enterprise Cloud providers(DataCore, Wasabi, ObjectMatrix).

**[MDS Collection](https://medium.com/@azaikin/building-mds-collection-from-a-fan-side-project-to-10-000-users-f8d0d5f63311)** — AI-Powered Audio Archive App of famous radio broadcast Model for assembly.
Mobile app for 1,600+ audio stories with semantic search via Qdrant, BGE-M3, and reranking. 12K+ users (2K MAU). Automated ingestion pipeline: local Whisper → OpenAI API → BGE-M3 → Qdrant → annotation and image generation.

**[First Line Outsourcing](https://flo.team)** — Software Company (Founded 2017, Closed 2025)
Built from scratch to 25 people. Full-cycle custom development: web, mobile, desktop, cloud. Clients: EA, Google, NBCUniversal, CNN, Riot Games, MLS, MGM, Houston Rockets. Managed hiring, sales, presales, system design, delivery, and hands-on development.
